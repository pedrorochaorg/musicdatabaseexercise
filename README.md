# Music Database Exercise

This APP is publicly available in Heroku [MusicDatabaseExercise][heroku]

Music Database Exercise is the name given to an skill test exercise developed by Pedro Rocha during it's free time.
This exercise is based in the popular framework Django powered by the powerfull Python Programing language. The versions used to build and necessary to run this exercise are:

  - [Python 3.5.4][python]
  - [Pip 8.1.2][pip]
  - [VirtualEnv 15.0.3][virtualenv]
  - [PostgreSQL 9.5.4][postgresql]


Has requested by the test examinatores, this exercise has to be able to :

  - Add, Edit, Remove Users;
  - Add, Edit, Remove Musics,
  - Add, Remove Musics to the User Music Favorite List.
  - Populate the Music Database with data from http://freemusicarchive.org/recent.json

### Please notice that,
I focused on learning the base fundamentals of the Django Framework and  Django Rest Framework, every piece of code has been writen based on the result of 3 days of learning/coding.

### Development Notes,
The API has been built on top of Django Python Framework using the Django Rest Framework 'module'.
The AngularJS webapp has been scafolded using [Yeoman][yo] with the Angular [generator][yoangular].

## Setting up the APP
Before you run the Django server, first you need to setup a new virtualenv. Run the following bash command, inside the project root folder:

```sh
$ python3 -m venv myvenv
```

With the command above a new Virtualenv, named myenv, will be created in your system, next you should activate/enter the created virtual env. For that purpose run the following shell command, inside the project root folder:

```sh
$ source myenv/bin/activate
```

##Installing Dependencies
This app requires some dependencies to run properly, Django is on of them.
To install all dependecies run the following in your bash , inside the project root folder:


```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```



##Databases
This app requires the use of a postgres database, for the app to run you have to install PostgreSQL and create a new user, and a new database with the created user as it's owner.

Example, on your PostgreSQL shell run the following commands:
```sql
CREATE USER musicdatabase;

CREATE DATABASE musicdatabase OWNER musicdatabase;

```

With the databases created you have to edit the Project settings file to change the Database default settings MusicDatabase/settings.py:
The Database configs should be placed in this file, on the line 88, where you will find the following text:

```py

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
        'NAME': 'musicdatabase',
        'USER': 'musicdatabase',
        'PASSWORD': '',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '',
    }
}

```

Now and finaly you have to tell Django to create all required Data Tables through it's migration process, to do this you have to run the following shell command in your project root folder:


```sh
$ python manage.py migrate
```


##Optional
If you wish to populate the Musics Data Table with fresh data from http://freemusicarchive.org/recent.json, run the following shell command inside your project root folder.

```sh
$ python manage.py populate
```



## Running the APP

To start the webserver and run the app, just type the following in your shell, while located on your app's root folder:

```sh
$ python manage.py runserver
```

And finaly open the following url in your browser

 - [http://localhost:8000][localhost]

Please notice that your firewall may block this communication, allow communications on the port 8000.




##WebSite Development Notes
To run the WebAPP in development mode, you are required to do a couple of more initialization steps.
The WebAPP uses bower to manage it's dependencies, and requires some NPM Modules to be built and tested.

###Dependencies

  - [NodeJS 4.4.7][nodejs]
  - [NPM 3.10.5][npm]
  - [Bower][bower]
  - [Grunt][grunt]
  - [Compass][compass]
  - [Ruby][ruby]

To install some of these dependecies ( Grunt, Bower, Compass *( Ruby First! )* ), you have to open your shell inside the Project Root folder and type the following command:


```sh
$ cd websitedev
$ npm install -g grunt-cli bower
$ gem install compass

```

###Setup Dev Environment

After installing the dependecies listed above, you need to run the following commands:

Installs all required npm modules

```sh
$ npm install
```

Installs all required bower dependencies

```sh
$ bower install --save
```

###Run Dev Server
To run the webserver and see the APP Running, type in the <Project Root>/websitedev:

```sh
$ grunt serve
```

###Building the Website
To build the website you need to run the following grunt task

```sh
$ grunt build
```

Please note that changes made on the index.html file, have to be manually merged with the file present at <ProjectRoot>/website/templates/website/index.html , this file contains python template tags that allow the webapp static files to be served by the django web server.
